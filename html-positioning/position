position: static | fixed | absolute | relative

position: static
default
browsers calculate the box position based on the document flow
elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow

position: fixed
needs coordinates top & left or right & bottom
The element is positioned in relation to the viewing window, not document 
When the page scolls down, the box will still in the viewing window

position: relative
needs coordinates top & left or right & bottom
The element is positioned in relation to itself, shift the element top & left or right & bottom  

position: absolute
needs coordinates top & left or right & bottom
The element is positioned relative to its first or nearest positioned (not static) ancestor element
Remove it from the document flow so it does not affect other elements that are rendered

cases:
1. overlapping elements: fixed | absoute
2. need coordinates, able to position: fixed, relative, absolute
3. two boxes are next to each other, the margins will collapsed
